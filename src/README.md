## Reflection

- This was a relatively simple project to take on. I had previously reached this point in The Odin Project and found myslef unfamiliar with React State & Hooks and creating function based components.

- I spent time learning React better with online courses and tutorials before returning to pick up this project. Once I had spent time learning this area of React I was able to implement this app with a fair amount of ease.

- The most challenging part was coming up with an algorithm which would return a random list of cards whilst ensuring at least one card is yet to be clicked. Although with the use of Math.Random() and filtering the array this was a relatively simple solution.

- For this project I decided to work with inline-styling. As this was to remain a simple project I thought it would be suitable to implement this rather than creating seperate CSS files.

- I enjoyed created this task, as little projects help me improve my problem-solving and prepare me better for interview coding challenges. I also feel it's important to get hands dirty and create code from scratch without the aid of a tutorial as this is where I feel my knowledge is best concreted.

- This project also helped me to practice using constructor functions (for creating the card objects) as this was an area I hadn't revisited for a while.

## Future Improvements/Features

- I am happy with how this project is as it stands
